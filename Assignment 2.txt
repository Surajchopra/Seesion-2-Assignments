SESSION 3: FOUNDATIONAL R PROGRAMMING 
Assignment 2 

1. Create an m x n matrix with replicate(m, rnorm(n)) with m=10 column vectors of n=10 elements each, constructed with rnorm(n), which creates random normal numbers. 

• Then we transform it into a dataframe (thus 10 observations of 10 variables) and perform an algebraic operation on each element using a nested for loop: at each iteration, every element referred by the two indexes is incremented by a sinusoidal function, compare the vectorized and non-vectorized form of creating the solution and report the system time differences. 


Answer:

#Vectorized form
set.seed(42)

#create matrix
mat<- replicate(10,rnorm(10))

#transform into data frame
df <- data.frame(mat)
df <- df + 10*sin(0.75*pi)

#non-vectorized form

set.seed(42)

#create matrix
mat <- replicate(10,rnorm(10))

#transform into data frame
df <- data.frame(mat)

for(i in 1:10){
  for(j in 1:10){
    df[i,j]<- df[i,j] + 10*sin(0.75*pi)
    print(df)
    }
}

#time difference

system.time(
      df[i,j]<- df[i,j] + 10*sin(0.75*pi)
)

system.time(
  for(i in 1:10){
  for(j in 1:10){
    df[i,j]<- df[i,j] + 10*sin(0.75*pi)
   }
  }
 )
