SESSION 3: FOUNDATIONAL R PROGRAMMING 
Assignment 1 
 
1. Define an m x n matrix of zeros and then enters a nested-for loop to fill the locations of the matrix, only if the two indexes differ. 

• The purpose is to create a lower triangular matrix, that is a matrix whose elements below the main diagonal are non-zero, the others are left untouched to their initialized zero value. 

• When the indexes are equal (if condition in the inner loop, which runs over j, the column index), a break is executed and the innermost loop is interrupted with a direct jump to the instruction following the inner loop, which is a print; then control gets to the outer for condition (over the rows, index i), which is evaluated again. 

• If the indexes differ, the assignment is performed and the counter is incremented by 1. 

• At the end, the program prints the counter ctr, which contains the #number of elements that were assigned. 

Answer:

mat1 <- function(n, x){
  mat <- matrix(0, nrow = n, ncol = n)
  mat[row(mat) > col(mat)] <- x
  mat
}

value <- 1:6
mat1(4, value)

for (i in 1:6) {
  for (j in 1:6) {
    mat <- matrix(1:6,3,3)
    mat[lower.tri(mat)] <-0
    print(mat)
   
  }
  
}
